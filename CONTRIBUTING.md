# Pitching an article to the Hoodie blog

As an open-source editorial team, we do things a bit differently than other editorial projects. We have a **completely transparent process** for blog posts, where anyone can see what's happening, and get involved at any stage. As a writer, it may be a bit daunting at first to have your work completely in the open, but we believe it fosters a greater collaborative environment in our community.

Before pitching an article to us, we ask that you first read our [initiatives for Hoodie](http://hood.ie/initiatives/) and our [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/). This will give you an idea of what type of content we want for our blog. If your idea doesn't exactly fit in our initiatives, but you still think it could work on our blog, do pitch it anyway. We're open to lots of ideas. :smile:

Next, we ask that you look at [the overview of our blog post process](documents/blog-process.md). This will give you an idea of how we work, and what we'll be asking from you. If anything is unclear, feel free to ask us questions at any time.

Once you've read those two documents, you're ready to send us your pitch! We use the GitHub issues on this repository to accept blog post pitches. We ask that you use [this pitch template](documents/pitch-template.md) for your pitch, as it gives us the information we need, and lets us start the reviewal process for your pitch as soon as possible.

Good luck, and have fun! We're ecstatic that you want to write for us, and we hope we can make something great together. :sparkles:

# Joining the Hoodie editorial team

If you'd like to contribute to the Hoodie project's editorial in a way different than writing, we'd love to have you! We need editors, illustrators, social media managers, [and much more](documents/team-roles.md). Additionally, we need some writers to contribute to posts about the Hoodie project. If any of these roles interest you, or you have a role you're sure we need but don't even have listed, you should definitely join us.

If you'd like to help, [sign up for our Slack group](http://hood.ie/chat), and send a hello in [the #editorial channel](https://hoodie-community.slack.com/messages/editorial/). As well, you should [watch this repository](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/subscription) to get notifications of the latest projects you can help with. Finally, take a look at our [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/) to get a sense of the environment we foster. We can't wait to work with you! :tada:
