# How to Submit Cute Animals in Clothes to Our Tumblr

So you've found a picture of a cute animal wearing clothes, and you'd like it
to be featured on our [tumblr blog](http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com/)?

Fantastic! By navigating to the blog, [http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com/](http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com/), you
should find a link in the sidebar on the right, titled "submit a post".

Once you click that link, you'll see a page that contains the following:

Here you can upload the picture you would like to appear on a blog, plus a
caption if you want. Feel free to add your name into the caption, so that the
world can see who came up with that cute picture. If you found the picture
online, it'd be great if the caption could include a link to either the original
owner, or at least where you found it.

That's it! You're all done, thanks for contributing, and please think of us the
next time you find a cute animal wearing clothes. (We :sparkling_heart: hoodies, but
are accepting of all kinds of clothing).
