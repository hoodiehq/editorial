People who contribute to the Hoodie editorial team in a way that furthers the editorial team's success are able to become GitHub Contributors to the editorial repository. Most people expect a high barrier to entry with this - in reality, however, you don't have to be a super hero to help out!

## What is a GitHub Contributor, and why would I want to be one?
When a person is marked as a contributor on GitHub, they are given the responsibility of being able to close Issues and PRs, merge PRs, and contribute directly to the repo's branches.

When we make someone a contributor, we are putting trust in that person. That trust is that you won't intentionally or maliciously do anything that will hurt the editorial team. Outside of that, the only assumption we make is that guidelines are followed before committing or merging to the main repository. You can find the appropriate guidelines for each procedure in the `/documents` folder of this (`editorial`) repository.

## Other types of contributors
Those who accept PRs and merge content are not the only type of contributors we are looking for. People who contribute social media content, who create visuals such as photographs or illustrations, and who manage synchronous publishing are all equally valid contributors to the project.

The Hoodie editorial process is completely managed through GitHub, so anyone that meets the standard of being a good contributor (again - not a super hero!) in these areas will be added as a contributor to the GitHub repo - in the same way that those who create and edit written communications are. Being added as a contributor visibly marks that we trust you, and want to empower you to do what you do with Hoodie's editorial content.
