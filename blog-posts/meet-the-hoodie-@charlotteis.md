###*What's your favourite animal*

The Fox. They used to hang out underneath my bedroom window in London at 2am every night, and I think they're very beautiful creatures! If I had to own an animal, it would probably be a Cat. Cats are cool because they seem to have a much more introverted and independent personality than other animals, just like me.

###*What's your role / what have you contributed to Hoodie?*

I came to Hoodie in May 2015. One day I was bored and someone on Twitter (probably [@janl](https://twitter.com/janl)) mentioned Hoodie. I checked it out and noticed some spelling mistakes on the main website so I started firing off a flurry of Pull Requests and they were all accepted! I was also discovering Accessibility at the time (and still am) so I started PR'ing accessibility improvements to various repositories.

Now, I'm fully employed and I don't get a lot of time to work on things. So my contributions are mainly talking with people in Slack and listening to peoples ideas (also known as [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), it is a very important part of teamwork). Recently I've helped start the Hoodie Editorial team which is going really well and they are producing awesome blog posts and works like this very one I am writing in (meta!). 

In 2016 I want to get better at JavaScript and use the Hoodie internals as a way of learning, so hopefully I'll start to contribute features that Hoodie users will love.

###*What's your favourite use of Hoodie in the wild?*

Reading the [minutes.io case study](http://hood.ie/blog/minutes-offline-case-study.html) written by [Alex](https://twitter.com/espylaub), was fascinating, so that's probably my favourite use. However this is totally considered cheating as minutes.io came before Hoodie and is what Hoodie was born out of!

In general, all uses of Hoodie are my favourite (yes, I know, I'm cheating the question). It's a joy to see people come to talk us in [Slack](https://hood.ie/chat) and share their prototypes and applications with us.

###*What in your opinion makes the Hoodie project unique and interesting?*

The community. I'm happy to say this, and have said this to other Hoodie members in the past; but Hoodie (the thing you use to build awesome applications) is something I often do not pay much attention to. Ninety nine percent of my focus is on the people who make that project.

Since I have been a part of Hoodie I have seen it go through a lot of evolution. We've shifted our focus from "code code code" to "how can we help others to code with us?". We've hosted some fantastic people from the Rails Girls Summer of Code, we regularly discuss the accessibility of the Hoodie experience and we're just now starting to hold events to introduce people to Open Source.

There are many fantastic communities out there, but I feel that Hoodie is a unique example of a well established project where some of their best teachings are people-based rather than code-based. We have a long way to go and will never be finished, but it is refreshing to be a part of this positive attitude within Open Source.

###*What advice do you have for aspiring Hoodie contributors?*

Don't think you're not good enough for Hoodie, or you don't have the right skill set. The main thing you need to contribute to Hoodie, is the desire to contribute to Hoodie! Don't think you can't come and sit with us and do cool things, we need you to work with us to make Hoodie better.

We have a range of ways you can contribute:
- dreaming up Hoodie APIs
- programming the backend in Node.JS, Hapi and PouchDB/CouchDB.
- designing and maintaining nice front-end experiences for thing parts of Hoodie that need them
- helping our [editorial team](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial) curate tweets, blog posts and newsletters to inform the world about what we're up to
- hanging out in our [Slack](http://hood.ie/chat), answering support questions
- commenting on and testing the code we write on [GitHub](https://github.com/hoodiehq)
- submitting pictures of cute animals wearing clothes to our [Tumblr](http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com/)

We need people to show us how we can do a better job of supporting you.

Mostly importantly, and this goes for whatever project you've decided to spend time on be it Hoodie or something else: make sure you're having fun with it!

This thumbs up is for you!
