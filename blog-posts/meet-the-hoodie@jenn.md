###*What’s your favourite animal?*

Assuming I can choose any animal, living, extinct or magical, I’m going to go ahead and choose the
[phoenix](http://img03.deviantart.net/fee7/i/2012/240/6/a/the_phoenix_card_by_william19-d5csbhp.jpg).
Long before [Fawkes](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fawkes) was Dumbledore’s go-to companion I was
a small school girl in the early 90’s reading X-Men comic books on the school bus home and completely
smitten with [Jean Grey’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Grey) character whose ultimate
transformation was into the Cosmic Phoenix force. Nerd alert, right?

Since adulthood, I’ve come to enjoy the tabula rasa aspect of what the cycle of regeneration the
phoenix symbolizes, and I can identify several periods of my life by when I had to “burn” and start again. 

###*What’s your role / what have you contributed to Hoodie?*###

For the last couple of years I’ve been a Hoodie fan and cheerleader. When I was at [&yet](https://andyet.com/)
we had a very mutual adoration of their team (and hopefully they felt similarly). At the end of 2015 I joined
the project as a member of the recently formed [editorial team](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial) because
of my enthusiasm for Hoodie and my complete adoration of the wonderful people involved like
[Charlotte Spencer](https://twitter.com/Charlotteis), [Jan Lehnardt](https://twitter.com/janl),
[Gregor Martynus](https://twitter.com/gr2m) and [Nick Hehr](https://twitter.com/hipsterbrown).

Also, in this last month I joined the Hoodie team as the editor of the
[Hoodieletter](http://us4.campaign-archive1.com/?u=12d36bbe9418ed6a43127cd62&id=6845376e0a),
the monthly dispatch covering all things Hoodie and Hoodie Community! I’m very excited to write entertaining
things for you all and spread awesome sauce all over the community.  

###*What’s your favorite use of Hoodie in the wild?*###

So being very new to functional code means that currently my favorite use of Hoodie isn’t your typical one,
but I think it very much embodies the ethos of the project and the community. Hoodie’s support of the
[Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/) project which helps mentor
women getting into Open Source full time. It’s an amazing way to invest in your community for Open Source
projects and Hoodie sponsors multiple teams at a time. I just love that the Hoodie folks are truly about
the people behind the technology and this is another example of that. 

###*What in your opinion makes the Hoodie project unique and interesting?*###

Okay one, [animals in hooded sweatshirts](http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com/) is about the most unique and
interesting thing I can think of. Okay maybe not, but at least they’re adorable and that’s what counts when
it comes to animals and internet. So mainly the thing that interested me in the project was the people,
individually and within the greater community. I’ve been a fan of Hoodie for a long time because the heart
of the project feels so tangible, even through the web, from halfway around the globe! Getting to meet them
slowly at events like JSConf.eu and Meet the Hoodies meetups only confirmed how much I admire these folks. 


###*What advice do you have for aspiring Hoodie contributors?*###

If you can, go to a Meet the Hoodies event but if not, [join the Slack](http://hood.ie/chat/). Everyone is
very friendly and there’s [definitely a spot for you to contribute](http://hood.ie/contribute/) even if
you’re not into code.

If you are looking to write some functions and yell at your screen a little, there
are a lot of [starter issues](http://go.hood.ie/hoodie-starter-issues) to jump in on, and it seems like,
in terms of tech there’s a little something for everyone. 

But really, just jump in and do something. Say hi in Slack, comment on an issue, open an issue. You won’t
break anything I promise. What’s more fun anyway? Wasting time on the internet alone or making new friends
from all over the world by joining an Open Source project?
