# The Hoodie Editorial Team

:rocket: Welcome to the home of the Hoodie Editorial Team! :rocket:

## Mission Statement

The Hoodie Editorial Team exists to support [Hoodie’s Initiatives](http://hood.ie/initiatives/) ([Offline First](http://hood.ie/initiatives/#offline-first), [noBackend](http://hood.ie/initiatives/#nobackend), [Hoodie is Dreamcode](http://hood.ie/initiatives/#dreamcode), [tools](http://hood.ie/initiatives/#tools) and products, and encouraging [Non-Coding Contributors in Open Source](http://hood.ie/initiatives/#noncoders)) through writing documentation, writing content for a website or blog to design, editing, public relations, social media and much more.

The Editorial Team follows Hoodie’s [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/). 

:alarm_clock: Please check out our [wiki](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/wiki) for our language styleguide and a glossary of common terms, which will be really useful when you write for Hoodie! :alarm_clock: 

## What is the Editorial Team?

The Editorial Team is a group that focuses on Hoodies' communication with the wider community. We want to keep community members up to date with what we are doing but also showcase it to everyone who has used/is using/wants to use Hoodie for their project. We want to make Hoodie as open as possible with their process and act as a source of inspiration to the larger Open Source community.

We:
- **Plan and write blog posts** on or around Hoodie, Hoodie releases, side projects, TGIF, community member profiles, conference and meetup recaps, etc. :memo:
- **Solicit and curate contributions** to our blog from the larger community. :mag_right:
- **Plan and manage our Twitter account**, announce new content, help funnel support requests to the engineering team.
- Add **pictures of animals in clothing** to [our tumblr](http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com) :dog: :shirt:.
- **Whatever else you think is fun!**

## What can I find here?

Here you will find a growing repository of documentation for the Editorial Team. From how to submit a PR to the blog, to how to write a TGIF! (Thank Gallileo, Gauss and Grohl It's Friday!) post, to the language we use when writing for Hoodie. We want to write everything possible to ensure everyone who wants to write for Hoodie, can. :ok_woman:

You can also take a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/wiki) for editorial resources like the [style guide](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/wiki/Hoodie-Language-Style-Guide) and [glossary](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/wiki/Glossary-of-common-terms).

## How can I get involved?
