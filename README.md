# The Hoodie Editorial Team

:rocket: Welcome to the home of the Hoodie Editorial Team! :rocket:

## What is the Editorial Team?

The Editorial Team is a group that focuses on Hoodies' communication with the wider community. We want to keep community members up to date with what we are doing but also showcase it to everyone who has used/is using/wants to use Hoodie for their project. We want to make Hoodie as open as possible with their process and act as a source of inspiration to the larger Open Source community.

We:
- **Plan and write blog posts** on or around Hoodie, Hoodie releases, side projects, TGIF, community member profiles, conference and meetup recaps, etc. :memo:
- **Solicit and curate contributions** to our blog from the larger community. :mag_right:
- **Plan and manage our Twitter account**, announce new content, help funnel support requests to the engineering team.
- **Help co-ordinate The Hoodie Letter and Offline First newsletters.
- Add **pictures of animals in clothing** to [our tumblr](http://meetthehoodies.tumblr.com) :dog: :shirt:
- **Whatever else you think is fun!**

## What can I find here? 

Here you will find a growing repository of documentation for the Editorial Team. From how to submit a PR to the blog, to how to write a TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) post, to the language we use when writing for Hoodie. We want to write everything possible to ensure everyone who wants to write for Hoodie, can. :ok_woman:

## I have a blog post proposal!

Well firstly, amazing! :tada: Thank you for considering writing for Hoodie :sparkling_heart:.
