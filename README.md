# The Hoodie Editorial Team

:rocket: Welcome to the home of the Hoodie Editorial Team! :rocket:  
  
## What is [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/)?

[Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) is a global, __inclusive community__ built around supporting the __open source__ software development effort of enabling (and empowering) folks to be able to build applications for the web and iOS. It accomplishes this by serving as a complete backend for your apps; it works immediately “out-of-the-box”: __develop your frontend code, plug it into Hoodie’s frontend-friendly API and your app is ready.__

Hoodie can refer to both the software development project, and the broader community. For more information about both, visit [hood.ie](http://hood.ie/).

## What is open source?

[Open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (commony abbreviated as OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner, for example, by __hosting code on GitHub__ and __collaborative discussion on Slack__.

[Click here for more information on open source and open source culture](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), and [here’s a helpful list of frequently asked questions](https://opensource.com/resources). 

## We are an inclusive community first

Hoodie is an open source project and community __“beyond software.”__ Our team strongly believes that open source, an integral component of modern technology, is changing the way people collaborate and create, and that extends far beyond the source code.  

Hoodie is built by an amazing and dedicated community consisting of developers and non-coding experts. It relies on strong values like diversity, empowerment and decentralisation. At its core Hoodie exists to empower people and make web development easier and more accessible to a wide range of people.

We require all participation within the Hoodie project and community to act according to a [Code of Conduct](http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/). We ask you to follow these guidelines which help steer __our interactions__ and strive to keep Hoodie a positive, growing project and community and help us __provide and ensure a safe environment for everyone__.

## What does the editorial team do?

The Editorial Team is one of many talented teams that contributes to Hoodie’s success. __Our primary focus is Hoodies’ communication with the wider community.__ We want to keep community members up to date with what we are doing but also showcase it to everyone who has used/is using/wants to use Hoodie for their project. We want to make Hoodie as open as possible with their process and act as a source of inspiration to the larger Open Source community.

## How you can contribute

__If you already have an idea of what you would to do__ please visit the [Issues section](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues) of this repository. The [Issues section](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues) is where we keep track of potential editorial contributions, requests for help, and general suggestions. 

Here are some of the issues we are working on :point_right: [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/hoodiehq/editorial.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/hoodiehq/editorial) and  [![Stories in Progress](https://badge.waffle.io/hoodiehq/editorial.svg?label=In%20Progress&title=In%20Progress)](http://waffle.io/hoodiehq/editorial)

When claiming a task please do the following:

1. Find a task with the green `help wanted` label 
2. Claim this issue (`comment on the issue or assign yourself`)
3. Remove `ready` label, add `in progress` label
4. If possible, give an indication of the timeline :relaxed:

__If you are brand new to Hoodie__ check out our [contribution guide](http://hood.ie/contribute/). We’re looking for people of all sorts, so don’t be afraid to get involved. If you’re passionate about contributing to a great community, we want you!

__If you are brand new to open source (including GitHub)__ first, welcome! If you haven’t checked it out yet, [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) has some very helpful introductory resources that will give you a good understanding of the premise of open source and its ecosystem. 

To be a Hoodie contributor, you will need a GitHub account (which is free for open source), [sign up here](https://github.com/join). To get familar with GitHub as an online tool, they have created several tutorials which you can find via [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/).

You will also need to know [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. GitHub provides a [Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and Daring Fireball has a particular thorough resource on [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). 

__Please be assured you will not have to have any prior knowledge of code or development to be a Hoodie contributor, especially within the Editorial team.__

## How to use GitHub  

The way in which the Editorial team uses GitHub is a bit different from other areas on the Hoodie team. 

This repository (or collection) serves as the source of truth for the Editorial team. We use the repository in two ways:

+ __Documentation__ of processes and resources (such as our style guide, or templates for types of reoccuring writing contributions)
+ __Idea capturing__ of all editorial contributions through the Issues section of this repository

We do not publish anything live to the externally facing websites from this repository. This is a __safe place to learn, ask questions, and make mistakes.__ So breathe easy. :relaxed:

__Some GitHub basics__
+ [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)
+ [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
+ [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
+ [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
